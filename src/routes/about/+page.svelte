    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>hi! i'm <a href='https://unoptimal.com' target="_blank">unoptimal</a>.</p>
    <p>theres a particular genre of creative, miscellaneous content that i enjoy making, thinking about, and looking at.</p>
    <p>the term i've adopted to describe them is <a href='https://unoptimal.com/essays/backpage' target="_blank">"backpage content"</a>, inspired by the last page of my high school newspaper. <small> (not to be confused with the cringe craiglist knockoff site.)</small></p>
    <p>but finding backpage content can be hard, as they're scattered across the internet! fortunately i am Extremely Online and keep stumbling onto them.</p>
    <p>so this website serves as a public facing, ongoing collection of ones <a href='/links'>i like</a>. join the mailist list to recieve weekly roundups <a href='/newsletter'>here</a>.</p>
